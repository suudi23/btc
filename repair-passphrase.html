	<h3>FAQ</h3>
	<dl>
	  <dt>What is a broken passphrase?</dt>
	  <dd>A Counterwallet passphrase exists of 12 random words from a 1626 word dictionary. Any combiantion of these words is valid. If the passphrase contains a word <i>not</i> included in the dictionary, e.g. due to a typo, the passphrase is invalid or broken.</dd>
	  <dt>How is the passphrase repaired?</dt>
	  <dd>An invalid word is compared to all words in the 1626 word dictionary. The invalid word is replaced by its closest match. A slight modification of the Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm is used for this search.</dd>
	  <dt>Can every passphrase be repaired?</dt>
	  <dd>No, if there are no close matches, question marks are returned. Sometimes there may even be two close matches, and then the repaired passphrase may be different from the original one. E.g. you write "sing" instead of "song". The algorithm returns "swing".</dd>
	  <dt>What are the use cases?</dt>
	  <dd><ul><li>If you cannot login to Counterwallet, you may have written down a word wrongly (it's another real word, but one that's not included in the dictionary). This script will help you find the typo.</li><li>Wallet software can include this algorithm. Users will be able to log in despite mionor typos.</li></ul></dd>
